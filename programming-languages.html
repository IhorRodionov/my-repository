        I have programmed in different languages, perhaps I will tell you a
        little story in which all of them will be collected and how I got to
        programming in python.
      </p>
      <h2>Small story</h2>
      <p>
        If you own any other programming language, it will be very easy to learn
        Python. This is my story - I was programming in Java, but I suddenly
        needed to learn Python. There were no problems: the language is simple,
        the entrance threshold is low. I had my own projects in Java, but I
        liked Python better.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, I manage to write more code with this language. The
        productivity of a Python programmer is many times higher. Therefore, our
        team completely switched to this language. After a year of working with
        Python, you can become much more efficient.<br />
        For comparison, I have been suffering for three years with the Erlang
        and Elixir languages ​​and still don’t know much, because they have
        their own specifics. Python is less difficult.
