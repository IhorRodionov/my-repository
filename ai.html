        Smart machines have learned to bluff, outplay professionals in chess or
        Go, translate and recognize the human voice. Every week we learn about
        more and more exploits of computer programs that already know how to
        make medical diagnoses, draw as well as Rembrandt, sing or generate
        text. Should a person be afraid of artificial intelligence? Artificial
        intelligence (AI) has become a really hot topic in the last few years.
        Scientists associate this with the rapid development of neural networks
        (one of the areas of research in the field of artificial intelligence),
        which, in turn, became possible with the advent of powerful computers.
        "Since the early 2010s, influenced by the impressive success achieved by
        the use of multilayer neural networks (primarily convolutional and
        recurrent), this area has attracted serious attention from both
        scientists and engineers and from investors," comments the author one of
        the Russian chess programs, machine learning specialist Sergey Markov.
        The scientific community can argue about the timing of the emergence of
        smart machines, but they agree on one thing: the development of
        technology will have an unconditional impact on society, economy and
        relations between people in the future. Already, there are calls to
        consider ethical principles for developing artificial intelligence,
        making sure that artificial intelligence is developing in a direction
        that is safe for humans.
