    Smart machines have learned to bluff, outplay professionals in chess or Go,
    translate and recognize the human voice. Every week we learn about more and
    more exploits of computer programs that already know how to make medical
    diagnoses, draw as well as Rembrandt, sing or generate text. Should a person
    be afraid of artificial intelligence? Artificial intelligence (AI) has
    become a really hot topic in the last few years. Scientists associate this
    with the rapid development of neural networks (one of the areas of research
    in the field of artificial intelligence), which, in turn, became possible
    with the advent of powerful computers. "Since the early 2010s, influenced by
    the impressive success achieved by the use of multilayer neural networks
    (primarily convolutional and recurrent), this area has attracted serious
    attention from both scientists and engineers and from investors," comments
    the author one of the Russian chess programs, machine learning specialist
    Sergey Markov. The scientific community can argue about the timing of the
    emergence of smart machines, but they agree on one thing: the development of
    technology will have an unconditional impact on society, economy and
    relations between people in the future. Already, there are calls to consider
    ethical principles for developing artificial intelligence, making sure that
    artificial intelligence is developing in a direction that is safe for
    humans.
