    At school I liked different subjects, here is a list of them.

    I fell in love with mathematics since childhood. She set a clear structure of the world, which I really liked,<br>
    because I could understand everything with her help. Later this determined my direction in development.<br>
    I graduated from Lyceum 27 and went to artificial intelligence to get and improve my knowledge in this area.<br>
    The most beloved field was mathematical analysis, which opened completely new boundaries of the possibilities of mathematics<br>
    and brought the possibilities in the perception of the world around to a new level, but more interestingly, it made it possible<br>
    to explain to the computer how the world works.
    <h4 align="center" id="Programming">Programming</h4><br>
    When I got acquainted with the first programming language, I immediately realized that this is actually the same mathematics,<br>
    but translated into a language that a computer can understand. This electric assistant could calculate any task in milliseconds if explained to him.<br>
    I immediately became interested in this and began to transfer the algorithms I had learned in mathematics into the language of a computer. This continued<br>
    until I realized that even the capabilities of computers are limited. Then I got acquainted with the problem of optimization of algorithms,<br>
    which only expanded my boundaries of interests and knowledge.

    Exercise is very helpful to switch after brain activity and relax. Various physical activities can drive blood to the brain and make you think better.<br>
    During the exercise, various new and interesting ideas often came to me. It also keeps the body in good shape very well and helps to be healthy for a long time.
