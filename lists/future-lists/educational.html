    <p>
      Thanks to my studies at the university, I would like to acquire, first of
      all, communication skills, since my future professional activity and, in
      general, almost any human activity, his daily life depends on the success
      of communication. Also, fundamental academic knowledge necessary for my
      profession is very important for me: knowledge in the field of
      linguistics, philology, translation theory, communication theory, foreign
      languages. Moreover, the experience gained at the university will help me
      learn how to properly organize scientific activities, work with
      theoretical material, primary sources. After graduation.
