    <p>
      I would like to become a simultaneous interpreter in the field of
      international relations or in the field of management, work with English,
      French, Italian and German, but at the same time combine professional and
      scientific activities, namely: conduct research in the field of language
      theory, write scientific articles and, possibly, strive for obtaining a
      scientific degree. In any case, I would like to connect my life and my
      career with foreign languages, to be an expert in this field.<br />
