    I have many different hobbies, but such of them keep apart.
  <h3 id="Diving">Diving</h3>
  I have been doing it for 4 years and quite professionally. On my account there are already more than a hundred dives,<br>
  including technical ones. I love the aquatic environment as it gives a feeling of freedom and independence from the surroundings.<br>
  It gives you a break from the surrounding thoughts and re-comprehend some of your actions and thoughts.<br>
  <h3 id="firearm">Working with a firearm</h3>
  This type of weapon gives a sense of permissiveness and strength. You need to be able to overcome this, since this can be<br>
  extremely dangerous in any situation. I love weapons for their reliability and some grace and beauty. It helps to gather yourself<br>
  into a fist and continue to work further and makes you think about the consequences of any of your decisions.<br>
  <h3 id="Aikido">Aikido</h3>
  The philosophy of the East makes you think about the eternity of the world and about your soul. None of us are imperfect and then you realize it.<br>
  Improving the mind and body is the true path of a warrior in aikido, and this is the only thing that matters.<br>
