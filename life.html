        First of all, be sincere with yourself! Under pressure from the
        environment, public opinion, and fashion trends, people artificially
        place themselves in a “problematic” environment. The most important
        thing in life is to learn to move towards your happiness without
        disturbing the happiness of others. The most important thing is not to
        act against your will if you predict the course of events. Someone
        complains about the constant lack of money, although they have been
        working for 15 years in a nervous job with a small salary. It is
        important for someone to find happiness in marriage, but for more than 7
        years he / she has been looking for his ideal in his own interests.
        People deliberately go to pleasure, entertainment, live on the idea of
        ​​ideals for decades, but do not even want to spend several years on a
        specific goal.<br />
