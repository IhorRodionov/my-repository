        <p>For the God-Emperor I was drafted into the ranks of the imperial guard. There were many battles, including many orc attacks on our planet. Of the most interesting in 76, <br>
            the uprising in Kassel of the pontifik Skalin, who decided to go to Chaos. It is obvious that he was suppressed by our forces.</p>
        <li><b>Troops commissar </b>9 years</li>
        <p>Was promoted when single-handedly without rifle killed orks' Warlord and took his hand. On duty I lost my arm, both legs and eye, but all of them were changed with mechanical modifications</p>
    </ol>
    <h2>Science interests</h2>
    <p> I had not much interests, only economics and orks' language. Then I was interested in programming, math etc. </p>
    <h2>Awards</h2>
    <p>Most of my awards connected with battles, but few of them I earned while I was at school.</p>
