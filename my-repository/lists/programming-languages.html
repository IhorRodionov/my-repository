      I have programmed in different languages, perhaps I will tell you a little
      story in which all of them will be collected and how I got to programming
      in python.<br />
      <h3>Small story</h3>
      If you own any other programming language, it will be very easy to learn
      Python. This is my story - I was programming in Java, but I suddenly
      needed to learn Python. There were no problems: the language is simple,
      the entrance threshold is low. I had my own projects in Java, but I liked
      Python better.<br>
      In particular, I manage to write more code with this language. The productivity of a Python programmer is many times higher.
      Therefore, our team completely switched to this language. After a year of
      working with Python, you can become much more efficient.<br>
      For comparison, I have been suffering for three years with the Erlang and Elixir languages
      ​​and still don’t know much, because they have their own specifics. Python
      is less difficult.<br>
      <blockquote cite="https://vc.ru/promo/37415-zachem-izuchat-python">
        Python programmers are in high demand. If you indicate in your profile<br>
        on Github projects with Python that have at least 10-15 stars,<br>
        then you automatically get into the algorithms of HR specialists who<br>
        start to fill up with letters every two days: sit, choose and agree<br>
        to whatever you like.<br><br>
